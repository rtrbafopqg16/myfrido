## 🗄️ How to Add Data in Sanity CMS

### Step 1: Deploy Sanity Schema

1. Navigate to your Sanity project directory
2. The new schema is already added to `src/schemas/index.js`
3. Deploy the schema to Sanity Studio

### Step 2: Create Product Guides Document

1. Go to your Sanity Studio
2. Create a new **Product Guides** document
3. Fill in the following fields:

#### Product Handle
- Enter: `frido-orthotics-posture-corrector` (or your product handle)

#### How to Use Section:
- **Title**: "How to Use"
- **Video URL**: `https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/77427aa5e95b487c85a330da1e3a81fe.mp4`
- **Thumbnail** (optional): Upload a thumbnail image for the video
- **Steps** (optional): Add step-by-step instructions

#### Size Chart Section:
- **Title**: "Measure your perfect fit"
- **Tabs**: Add two tabs:

  **Tab 1: Product Dimensions**
  - Tab Name: "Product Dimensions"
  - Image: Upload or use URL: `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0553/0419/2034/files/SizeGuide_PC_1.png`
  - Description: (leave empty or add custom text)

  **Tab 2: How to Measure**
  - Tab Name: "How to Measure"
  - Image: Upload or use URL: `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0553/0419/2034/files/PostureCorrector_HowtoMeasure.jpg`
  - Description: "Measure around the widest part of your chest with a tape measure for the perfect fit posture support."

### Step 3: Save and Publish

1. Click "Publish" to make the content live
2. The popups will now display your custom content

## 🎨 Default Fallback Data

If no Sanity data is found, the popups will use these default values:

**How to Use:**
- Video URL: `https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/77427aa5e95b487c85a330da1e3a81fe.mp4`

**Size Chart:**
- Tab 1: Product Dimensions (`https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0553/0419/2034/files/SizeGuide_PC_1.png`)
- Tab 2: How to Measure (`https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0553/0419/2034/files/PostureCorrector_HowtoMeasure.jpg`)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User clicks "How to Use?" card** → Opens video popup
2. **User clicks "Measure your perfect fit" card** → Opens size chart popup with tabs
3. **Popups display:**
   - Content from Sanity CMS if available
   - Default content (Shopify URLs) if Sanity data not found
4. **Mobile-optimized:** Slide-up animation from bottom
5. **Desktop-optimized:** Center modal with backdrop

## 🎬 Video Format Support

The video player supports:
- MP4 format
- Autoplay control
- Mute/unmute toggle
- Loop playback
- Hardware-accelerated playback

## 📱 Mobile Experience

- Smooth slide-up animation

- Native share menu integration
- Swipe-to-close support (via close button)

## 🖼️ Image Optimization

All images are:
- ✅ Automatically optimized via OptimizedImage component
- ✅ Cached for better performance
- ✅ Responsive (adapts to screen size)
- ✅ Lazy-loaded where appropriate

## 🔄 API Integration

Data is fetched from:
```
/api/sanity/{productHandle}?type=all
```

Includes:
- Product Features

## 📊 Performance
